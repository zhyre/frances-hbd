            <p>My Dearest, Frances</p>

            <p>
              It has been a year since my first birthday greeting. From a simple 'happiest birthday, bea' to this long message. I’m amazed at the person u’re becoming and u've become. I know life hasn’t always been easy for u, and sometimes u carry more than anyone should pero u’ve faced it all with so much strength and grace. I admire u deeply, not just for what u’ve achieved, but for the way u stay kind, caring, and true to urself through everything.
            </p>

            <p>
              To me, u’ll always be both, the little squishy baby Bea who deserves to be protected, and the big Bea who inspires me every single day. I promise I’ll always take care of u, through every version of u, through every season of life. Whenever things get heavy, please remember u don’t have to carry it alone anymore. You can always lean on me and we’ll face it together, side by side, back to back.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thank u for letting me love u, for making me laugh, for teaching me things shehe, and for giving me something so beautiful to wake up to every day. Cheers to 21 and all the years ahead, filled with dreams, adventures, late-night cuddles, and pangluod but the kind of love that keeps growing. I love you more than words could ever explain, baby.
              <br>
